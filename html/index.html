<h1>IoP Annotation Review System</h1>
<br/><br/>
<p>Thank you for visiting the IoP Annotation Review System.</p>

<p>We're testing the validity of a tool that automatically tags and assigns keywords from the Unified Astronomy Thesaurus and IoP Thesaurus to papers submitted to the journals of the American Astronomical Society.</p>
<p>
In order to verify that automatically tagged keywords are relevant to the content they have been assigned, we are asking you to review articles that you recently published in the <i>Astronomical Journal</i>, <i>Astrophysical Journal</i>, <i>Astrophysical Journal Supplement</i>, or <i>Astrophysical Journal Letters</i>.</p>
<p>
When examining the list of suggested concepts in Step 1, ask yourself "Would someone searching specifically for this term find my paper useful?"  If your answer is “Probably not”, then check the box to mark the concept as Not Relevant.</p>
<p>
For Step 2, consider concepts that should be added to this paper.  Once you start typing, the input boxes will auto suggest known concepts, or you can add new ones that we will review and possibly insert into the Thesaurus.  If you add any concepts, be sure that they also satisfy the question: "Would someone searching specifically for this term find my paper useful?"  If your answer is “Yes”, write in the term.</p>
<p>
If you have any comments regarding the concepts you added or removed please include them in the provided space.  We are particularly interested in your reasoning behind adding or removing concepts, and your thoughts on how the new concepts relate to the topic of the article.</p>
<p>
Finally, we ask for you to include your email address so that we may follow up with your feedback and any questions we might have.  Your email address is kept private and will not be used for anything other than follow up on this project.</p>
<p>
Your feedback will be submitted to IoP Publishing and any new concepts you've suggested will be submitted to the <a href="http://astrothesaurus.org">Unified Astronomy Thesaurus</a>.</p>
